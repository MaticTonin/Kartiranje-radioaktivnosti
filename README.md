Kartiranje radioaktivnosti Slovenije.

In this folder you can find programs for automatization of creating maps for Slovenian radioactivity.

IF YOU RUN ON WINDOWS:
1. If you run on windows, and you have already download QGis, open OSGeo4W Shell. 
2. Go to directory, were your files are (in case you just downloaded the file, that directory is Kartiranje-radioaktivnosti-main/)
3. In OSGeo4W Shell type python Config.py (if you have python3, type python3). This should create the new bat files to execute your program automaticly.
4. After that, the instalation is complete. You can now run bat files in OSGeo4W Shell, by typing filename.bat

IF YOU RUN ON LINUX:
1. Unzip folder and go in it. There are two directories.
2. If you run on Linux go to Linux_installation. If you have not already installed QGIS type  chmod -R 777 ., press ENTER and then ./InstallQgis.bat
3. In cmd type chmod -R 777 ., press ENTER and then run ./Configuration.bat
   This should download all python plugins you need and create the new bat files to execute your program automaticly. (The question does not work with Caps     Lock).
4. After that, the instalation is complete. You can now run bat files with cmd by typing chmod -R 777 ., pressing ENTER and then run ./Filename.bat
